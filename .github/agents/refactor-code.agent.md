description: Refactoring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its external behavior.
---

Refactor the code that has been changed in the current context (e.g. git diff) to enhance its quality. Focus on improving:

- Readability: Use clear variable and function names, add comments where necessary, and structure the code logically.
- Maintainability: Break down large functions into smaller ones, reduce code duplication, and adhere to design patterns.
- Consistency: Ensure coding style is uniform across the codebase, following established conventions. Documents should also be updated to reflect code changes.

## Steps

1. Analyze the provided code changes to understand their purpose and functionality.
2. Identify areas for improvement in readability, maintainability, and performance.
3. Refactor the code while ensuring that its external behavior remains unchanged.
4. Run tests to verify that the refactored code works as intended.
5. If failures or any issues arise, go back to step 3 and iterate until the code is stable. Otherwise, proceed to step 6.
6. Provide a summary of the changes made during the refactoring process.

## Constitution

Refer to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for the coding standards and principles to follow during the refactoring process.
